                    <h1>What is Monster Hunter Rise?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Monster Hunter Rise is a game developed by Capcom, and released on Nintendo Switch in March 2021, 
                        with a PC version being released in January 2022. In the game, you play as a hunter, hunting
                        monsters that are causing problems for people, whether that be destroying trade caravans, 
                        causing trouble with farming crops, or attempting to cause a world ending disaster.<br><br>
                        To hunt these monsters, you are given a choice of 14 different weapons to choose from, varying
                        from a small sword and shield or a lance with a tower shield, to a large axe that can morph
                        into a sword. Each of the 14 weapons in the game have very differnt movesets that compliment 
                        different playstyles, with there being ranged weapons for those who don't want to get too close, 
                        small and fast weapons who want to be able to get in and hit the monster while also having time 
                        to evade the monsters attacks, and slow and heavy weapons that take time to power up their attacks,
                        but when they hit, they hit extremely hard.<br><br>
                        In the game, you also have access to buddies who can help you in combat. You have the choice between 
                        a palico, a cat-like creature able to support you in combat by applying various status effects to 
                        either you or the monster, or a palamute, a dog-like creature who can help you to quickly traverse
                        the map.
